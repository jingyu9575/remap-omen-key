# Remap OMEN key to Home
Remap the OMEN key to Home for HP OMEN laptops.

This branch creates a custom client that listens to the system and sends the HOME key event directly. It is supposed to be more responsive than the registry approach. 

The standalone branch does not require the driver "HP System Event Utility". However, administrator privileges are required.
